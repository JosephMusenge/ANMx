This repository showcases implementations of common numerical methods written in Python.  
It includes modules for root finding, solving linear systems, curve fitting, numerical integration, and solving differential equations — each developed with clear documentation and sample problems based on my coursework in *Applied Numerical Methods with Python for Engineers and Scientists*.
